#Udacity Full-stack Portfolio

* In project 1, the technologies I used were HTML5, Bootstrap (for CSS).
I validated my code using W3 Validator and Tidy.

* In project 2, I created a Javascript & JQuery-based resume. Each section: header, bio, work, education, projects were written in JSON. The Google Maps API read from my locations and mapped each area I worked into the map.
